🚀 Features

* Built with **Node.js** and **Express**
* Templating engine: **EJS**
* Session handling using **express-session**
* No-cache control for preventing back navigation after logout
* Static file serving (CSS, JS, images)
* Modular routing setup

---

📦 Dependencies

* [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) – Web framework
* [`ejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) – Template engine
* [`express-session`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) – Session management
* [`body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) – Parsing request bodies
* [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) – Generating unique session secrets
* [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) – Auto-restarting dev server
* [`nocache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nocache) – Disable client-side caching

⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/login_system.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd login_system

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

---

🧪 Running the App

```bash
# Start the server with nodemon
npm start
```

Once started, the server runs at:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

---

📄 Sample Routes

* `/` → Loads the login UI via `base.ejs`
* `/route/...` → Routes managed by `views/router.js`

---

💡 Study Notes

Also includes a **basic Node.js server** snippet using the `http` module:

```js
const http = require("http");

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-type': 'text/html'});
    res.end('Hello world');
}).listen(8080);
```

This demonstrates how to create a minimal server without Express.
